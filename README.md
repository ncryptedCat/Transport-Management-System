# üöç Transport Management System (TMS)

A comprehensive smart transportation management solution designed for educational institutions. This project leverages **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile and web apps and **Firebase** (Firestore + Hosting) for scalable, real-time backend infrastructure. The system improves student safety, bus monitoring, and emergency response through **barcode-based student authentication**, **live GPS tracking**, and **offline sync support**.

---

## Core Features

- **Barcode-based Student Authentication**  
  Each student‚Äôs ID card includes a barcode that is scanned during boarding to verify identity against a secure Firestore database.

- **Real-Time Bus Tracking with Geo-Fencing**  
  Live location updates every 30 seconds, route monitoring with alerts if the bus deviates more than 500 meters from its assigned path.

- **Emergency SOS System**  
  Mobile app allows students to send GPS-tagged SOS alerts to campus security‚Äîeven when offline.

- **Offline-First Functionality**  
  All modules support offline mode with Firestore‚Äôs data caching, syncing automatically when connectivity returns.

- **Flutter Web Admin Dashboard**  
  Centralized platform for admins to monitor all buses, student boarding, geo-fencing alerts, and feedback.

- **Student Feedback System**  
  App-integrated module to gather student feedback on transport quality and issues.
